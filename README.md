# CS-340-Client-Server-Development

#How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
  The method I used was to write in a modular style, with well documented progress. The use of comments and well documented names was very valulable in this process. As always, using the best practices is key.
  
#How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
  In this oocurse I learned a lot more in rageds to the Linux / Python connection. The appproach I used helped to understand the clients needs and design a solution that was what they desired. This was different in that there was an incorperation od multiple technologies to accomplish the build. It helped to to understand the intraworkings of computer applications and systems better. 
  
#What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
